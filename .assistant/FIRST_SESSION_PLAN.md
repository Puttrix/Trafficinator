## Summary

The Trafficinator project has been successfully migrated to the `.assistant/` workflow with:
- âœ… Complete canvas (vision, goals, stakeholders, questions, ideas, notes)
- âœ… Structured backlog with 14 prioritized items (P-001 through P-014)
- âœ… Now/Next/Later plan
- âœ… Historical timeline from project genesis to present
- âœ… Comprehensive status with risks, artifacts, and open questions
- âœ… 7 Architecture Decision Records documenting key choices

## Current State

### Project Health: **Stable** ðŸŸ¢
- Core functionality working well
- Production deployments successful
- Feature-complete for primary use cases
- In maintenance/polish mode

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Documentation alignment** (P-001, P-002) â€” Fix outdated references in CLAUDE.md
2. **Test coverage** (P-003) â€” Add tests for events, ecommerce, daily cap
3. **Configuration validation** (P-004) â€” Help users catch config errors early

---

## Recommended Next Session Actions

### Quick Wins (1-2 hours)
Choose any of these to start:

1. **Fix CLAUDE.md references** (P-001, P-002)
   - Update compose file names
   - Clarify embedded URLs
   - Quick documentation cleanup

2. **Add config validation script** (P-004)
   - Check required env vars
   - Test Matomo connectivity
   - Validate token_auth when using geolocation
   - Improve user experience

3. **Create load presets** (P-005)
   - Light: 1k/day (single user testing)
   - Medium: 10k/day (typical load testing)
   - Heavy: 50k+/day (stress testing)
   - Make it easier for new users

### Medium Tasks (3-6 hours)
For deeper work sessions:

4. **Enhance test coverage** (P-003)
   - Test event ordering guarantees
   - Test ecommerce order generation
   - Test daily cap pause/resume
   - Validate complex behaviors

5. **Improve user journey realism** (P-006)
   - Define persona templates (researcher, buyer, browser)
   - Implement multi-step funnels
   - Add cart abandonment simulation
   - More sophisticated traffic patterns

6. **Community feedback gathering** (P-014)
   - Create GitHub discussion or survey
   - Ask users about pain points
   - Prioritize future features based on actual needs
   - Validate roadmap assumptions

## Development Workflow

### Using `.assistant/` Structure

1. **Before starting work:**
   - Review `status.md` for current focus and risks
   - Check `plan.md` for prioritized tasks
   - Read relevant ADRs for context

2. **During work:**
   - Update `task_log.md` with progress notes
   - Mark backlog items as in-progress
   - Create new ADRs for significant decisions

3. **After completing work:**
   - Update `status.md` changelog
   - Mark backlog items as complete
   - Move completed tasks from plan
   - Add new insights to canvas if needed

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Run unit tests
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit

# Debug mode (50 visits, verbose logs)
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG MAX_TOTAL_VISITS=50 CONCURRENCY=5 docker compose up --build --abort-on-container-exit

# Quick validation
python test_minimal.py
python test_ecommerce.py
python test_ip.py
```

### Documentation Updates
When updating docs, ensure consistency across:
- `README.md` â€” Primary user documentation
- `CLAUDE.md` â€” AI assistant context (update for P-001, P-002)
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` â€” Deployment guide
- `.assistant/` â€” Internal project memory

## Open Questions to Consider

From `canvas/questions.md`, these are high-priority:

**Q1:** Should we add a control API?  
â†’ **Current stance:** Parked indefinitely (ADR-007)  
â†’ **Action:** Monitor user requests, revisit if strong demand emerges

**Q4:** Right balance between realism and configurability?  
â†’ **Current:** 30+ config options, complex but powerful  
â†’ **Action:** Consider presets (P-005) to help users get started

**Q10:** What documentation is missing for first-time users?  
â†’ **Current:** Comprehensive README, but may be overwhelming  
â†’ **Action:** Gather feedback (P-014), create quickstart if needed

---

## Long-Term Vision

Looking ahead (3-6 months):

1. **Stability & Polish**
   - Complete Now/Next items from plan
   - Improve test coverage
   - Refine documentation

2. **Community Building**
   - Gather user feedback
   - Encourage contributions
   - Share use cases and success stories

3. **Advanced Features** (only if demand exists)
   - Multi-target support (P-008)
   - Kubernetes manifests (P-011)
   - Plugin system (P-010)
   - Distributed load generation (P-012)

---

## Closing Notes

**Project is in good shape.** The migration to `.assistant/` workflow provides:
- Clear visibility into priorities and decisions
- Structured backlog with realistic estimates
- Historical context for future development
- ADRs explaining why things are the way they are

**No urgent issues.** Focus on polish and gradual improvements rather than major new features.

**Community-driven.** Future direction should be guided by actual user needs, not speculation.
