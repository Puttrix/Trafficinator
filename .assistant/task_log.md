# Task Log

## 2025-10-30
- tool: shell (`bash -lc "sed -n '1,200p' control-ui/app.py"`; `bash -lc "sed -n '400,520p' control-ui/static/js/presets.js"`).
- result: Reviewed backend FastAPI routes and frontend preset manager; confirmed `/api/presets` CRUD endpoints are absent even though the UI calls them, explaining why configuration persistence (P-018) fails.
- artifacts: none

- tool: apply_patch (control-ui/app.py, control-ui/models.py)
- result: Added FastAPI `/api/presets` CRUD endpoints backed by SQLite, plus Pydantic request/response models so the UI can list, create, update, and delete saved configurations with proper auth, rate limiting, and error handling.
- artifacts: none

- tool: shell (`bash -lc "python3 - <<'PY' ..."` smoke test)
- result: Exercised the SQLite helper against a temp database; create/list/get/update/delete all behaved as expected, confirming the persistence layer supporting the new endpoints works without a running FastAPI server.
- artifacts: none
