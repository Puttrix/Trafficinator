# Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-29 (Phase 2 Frontend Implementation Started)

---

## Focus
ðŸŽ¨ **Web UI Phase 2: Frontend Implementation** - Building responsive web interface with configuration forms, status dashboard, and log viewer.

**Current Priority:** Phase 2 - Frontend Features (P-020 âœ…, P-021, P-023, P-024)

---

## Now / Next / Later
See [plan.md](plan.md) for detailed roadmap.

**Now:** Phase 2 frontend features - P-021 (config form), P-023 (status dashboard), P-024 (log viewer), P-022 (presets)  
**Next:** Phase 3 polish - P-025 (UI enhancements), P-026 (integration testing), documentation updates  
**Later:** Nice-to-have features, advanced UI capabilities, community features

---

## Risks

### Technical
- **Web UI Complexity:** Adding web service increases attack surface and maintenance burden
- **State Synchronization:** Keeping UI state in sync with container state
- **Browser Compatibility:** Must test across multiple browsers
- **Security:** Auth, CORS, input validation, API abuse prevention
- **Token-bucket rate limiting:** May not handle burst scenarios optimally (existing)
- **Single-container scaling:** Limited to ~50k visits/day without distributed mode (existing)

### Product
- **Feature Creep:** UI may attract more feature requests, expanding scope
- **Maintenance Burden:** Single maintainer now responsible for backend + frontend + generator
- **User Expectations:** UI users may expect more polish and features
- **Documentation Load:** Need comprehensive UI docs in addition to existing docs

### Operational
- **Deployment Complexity:** Two services (generator + control UI) vs. one
- **Testing Complexity:** Integration testing between UI and generator
- **Support Load:** More questions about UI configuration, browser issues
- **Version Compatibility:** UI and generator versions must stay in sync

## Changelog

### 2025-01-29 â€” P-020 Complete: Frontend Foundation
- **Phase 2 Started:** Frontend implementation underway
- Created responsive web UI with Tailwind CSS (CDN-based)
- Built 4-tab navigation: Status, Config, Presets, Logs
- Implemented comprehensive UI helpers (loading, alerts, formatting)
- Created API client with authentication and error handling
- Added application controller with auto-refresh and lifecycle management
- Integrated static file serving in FastAPI
- Web UI accessible at http://localhost:8000/ui
- **Deliverables:** 4 new files (~550 lines frontend code), app.py updates
- **Next:** P-021 (configuration form) or P-023 (status dashboard) - can parallelize

### 2025-10-29 â€” P-019 Complete: Authentication & Security
- API key authentication via X-API-Key header
- Rate limiting with slowapi (10-60 req/min per endpoint)
- CORS middleware with configurable origins
- Security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, HSTS)
- Constant-time API key comparison (timing attack prevention)
- Fixed Docker SDK compatibility (urllib3<2, requests<2.29.0, docker 6.1.3)

### 2025-10-29 â€” P-017 Complete: Config Validation
- Comprehensive Pydantic validation for 25+ configuration fields
- Business rule validation (min <= max, percentages sum to 100%)
- Async Matomo connectivity testing
- Warning system for high-value configurations
- Validation endpoint with detailed error messages

### 2025-10-29 â€” P-016 Complete: Core REST API
- 7 API endpoints implemented (status, start, stop, restart, logs, validate, test-connection)
- Request/response models with Pydantic
- Container manager layer with proper error handling

## Open Questions (from canvas/questions.md)

### High Priority
- **Q1:** Should we add a control API? (Currently parked)
- **Q4:** Right balance between realism and configurability?
- **Q10:** What documentation is missing for first-time users?

### Medium Priority
- **Q2:** Is token-bucket optimal for all scenarios?
- **Q5:** Need more sophisticated user journey modeling?
- **Q8:** Is Watchtower the right auto-update strategy?

### Low Priority
- **Q3:** Distributed load generation support?
- **Q6:** Traffic replay from actual logs?
- **Q7:** Kubernetes manifest demand?
- **Q9:** SaaS-style hosted offering?
- **Q11:** Video tutorial investment worth it?
