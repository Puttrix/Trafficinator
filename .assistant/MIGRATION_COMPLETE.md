## 📁 What Was Created

### Canvas (`.assistant/canvas/`)
Strategic thinking and project context:
- ✅ **vision.md** — Problem statement, target users, success criteria, non-goals
- ✅ **goals.md** — Short/mid/long-term objectives
- ✅ **stakeholders.md** — Team, users, community structure
- ✅ **questions.md** — 11 open questions across architecture, features, deployment, community
- ✅ **ideas.md** — Future opportunities: traffic patterns, presets, monitoring, advanced features
- ✅ **notes.md** — Scratchpad with ecommerce design, architecture notes, performance characteristics

### Core Documents (`.assistant/`)
- ✅ **backlog.md** — 14 prioritized items (P-001 through P-014) with tags, estimates, acceptance criteria
- ✅ **plan.md** — Now/Next/Later structure with task references
- ✅ **history.md** — Project timeline from genesis through major milestones
- ✅ **status.md** — Current focus, risks, artifacts, changelog, open questions
- ✅ **FIRST_SESSION_PLAN.md** — Actionable next steps and workflow guidance

### Architecture Decision Records (`.assistant/adr/`)
- ✅ **ADR-001** — Docker-First Architecture
- ✅ **ADR-002** — Async Python with aiohttp
- ✅ **ADR-003** — Token-Bucket Rate Limiting
- ✅ **ADR-004** — Embedded URLs in Docker Image
- ✅ **ADR-005** — Geolocation via IP Override
- ✅ **ADR-006** — Timezone Configuration
- ✅ **ADR-007** — Configuration-Driven Design (No Control UI)
- ✅ **README.md** — ADR index and format guide

## 📊 Backlog Overview

### Now (Documentation & Maintenance)
- P-001: Update CLAUDE.md compose file references
- P-002: Update CLAUDE.md embedded URLs documentation
- P-003: Enhance test coverage (events, ecommerce, daily cap)

### Next (Usability & Reliability)
- P-004: Add configuration validation utilities
- P-005: Create load preset configurations (Light/Medium/Heavy)
- P-006: Improve realistic traffic patterns with user journeys
- P-014: Gather community feedback on priorities

### Later (Advanced Features)
- P-007: Evaluate Control UI/API feasibility (parked)
- P-008: Multi-target support
- P-009: Advanced reporting about load generation
- P-010: Plugin/extension system
- P-011: Kubernetes manifests
- P-012: Distributed load generation
- P-013: Video tutorials

## 🎯 Key Insights

### Project Health
- **Status:** Stable, feature-complete for primary use cases
- **Mode:** Maintenance and polish
- **Focus:** Documentation alignment, testing, usability

### Major Decisions Documented
1. **Docker-first** — Containerized for consistency and simplicity
2. **Async Python** — High concurrency with low overhead
3. **Token-bucket** — Smooth traffic distribution
4. **Embedded URLs** — Zero external dependencies
5. **IP override** — Global traffic simulation without infrastructure
6. **Timezone support** — Local time accuracy
7. **No control UI** — Configuration-driven by design

### Risks Identified
- Documentation drift (CLAUDE.md outdated)
- Test coverage gaps (complex behaviors under-tested)
- Single maintainer capacity
- Feature creep vs. simplicity balance
