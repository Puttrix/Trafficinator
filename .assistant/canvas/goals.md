# Goals

## Short-term (1–2 weeks)
- Document alignment: Update CLAUDE.md to reference correct docker-compose files and embedded URLs
- Improve test coverage for complex behaviors (events, ecommerce, daily cap)
- Polish documentation for production deployments

## Mid-term (1–2 months)
- Enhance realistic traffic patterns with more sophisticated user journeys
- Add validation/testing utilities for configuration
- Consider preset configurations (Light/Medium/Heavy load)

## Long-term (quarter+)
- Evaluate control UI/API feasibility (currently parked)
- Multi-target support (test multiple Matomo instances)
- Advanced reporting/metrics about load generation itself
- Plugin/extension system for custom traffic patterns
