# Vision

## Problem Statement
Matomo installations need to be performance-tested under realistic, high-volume traffic conditions to identify bottlenecks and validate optimizations. Existing tools either generate unrealistic traffic patterns or lack the configurability needed for proper load testing.

## Target Users
- **Matomo administrators** optimizing frontend/backend performance
- **DevOps engineers** stress-testing Matomo deployments
- **Performance engineers** conducting baseline vs. optimized comparisons
- **Matomo hosting providers** validating infrastructure capacity

## Success Definition
A tool that generates **realistic, high-volume traffic** (20k+ visits/day) with diverse user behaviors (site search, ecommerce, events, geolocation) to help teams:
- Identify performance bottlenecks in Matomo reports
- Validate optimization improvements with controlled load tests
- Populate test environments with realistic analytics data

## Non-Goals
- Real user monitoring or APM
- Production traffic replay
- Load testing non-Matomo systems
- General HTTP benchmarking tool
