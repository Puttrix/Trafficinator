# Trafficinator Backlog & Ideas

This document tracks generator-focused ideas, design notes, and implementation tasks.

## Tasks & Acceptance Criteria

1) Documentation alignment
- Update `CLAUDE.md` to reference `docker-compose.yml`/`docker-compose.prod.yml`.
- Note that URLs are embedded in the image rather than read from `config/urls.txt`.

---

## Nice-to-Haves (Future)

- Additional generator scenarios (if any) and docs polish
