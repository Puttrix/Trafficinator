## ‚ö° Usage  

### Docker Compose (Recommended)  
The project includes pre-configured Docker Compose setups:

#### Development/Local Testing
```bash
# Start load generation with default settings (builds locally)
docker-compose up --build

# View logs in real-time
docker-compose logs -f matomo_loadgen

# Stop the load generator
docker-compose down
```

#### Production/Remote Deployment
```bash
# Deploy with auto-updates using GHCR image
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f matomo_loadgen

# Stop
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
```

### Configuration  
Edit `docker-compose.yml` to customize your load test:

```yaml
environment:
  MATOMO_URL: "https://your-matomo-instance.com/matomo.php"
  MATOMO_SITE_ID: "1"
  TARGET_VISITS_PER_DAY: "20000"
  PAGEVIEWS_MIN: "3"
  PAGEVIEWS_MAX: "6"
  CONCURRENCY: "50"
  PAUSE_BETWEEN_PVS_MIN: "0.5"
  PAUSE_BETWEEN_PVS_MAX: "2.0"
  AUTO_STOP_AFTER_HOURS: "24"     # Stop after N hours (0 = disabled)
  MAX_TOTAL_VISITS: "0"           # Stop after N visits (0 = disabled)
  SITESEARCH_PROBABILITY: "0.15"  # Probability (0-1) that a visit includes site search
  VISIT_DURATION_MIN: "1.0"       # Minimum visit duration in minutes
  VISIT_DURATION_MAX: "8.0"       # Maximum visit duration in minutes
  OUTLINKS_PROBABILITY: "0.10"    # Probability (0-1) that a visit includes outlinks
  DOWNLOADS_PROBABILITY: "0.08"   # Probability (0-1) that a visit includes downloads
  CLICK_EVENTS_PROBABILITY: "0.25" # Probability (0-1) that a visit includes click events
  RANDOM_EVENTS_PROBABILITY: "0.12" # Probability (0-1) that a visit includes random events
```

### URL Structure  
The load generator uses a **3-level hierarchical URL structure** from `config/urls.txt`:
- **10 main categories**: products, blog, support, company, resources, news, services, solutions, documentation, community
- **5 subcategories each**: e.g., products ‚Üí hardware, software, accessories, bundles, enterprise  
- **40 pages per subcategory**: 2,000 total URLs for comprehensive testing

This creates realistic navigation patterns that will generate rich data in Matomo's:
- Page hierarchy reports
- Behavior flow analysis  
- Content performance metrics
- URL structure insights

### Site Search Simulation
The load generator includes **realistic site search behavior**:
- **Configurable probability**: Set `SITESEARCH_PROBABILITY` (0.0-1.0) to control how many visits include searches
- **35 realistic search terms**: Including 'product', 'support', 'documentation', 'pricing', 'features', etc.
- **Search categories**: Random assignment to Products, Support, Documentation categories (30% probability)
- **Result counts**: Simulates 0-25 search results per query
- **Natural placement**: Search events occur randomly within visit pageviews

This generates comprehensive data for Matomo's site search analytics, helping you test and optimize search-related reports and performance.

### Outlinks and Downloads Simulation
The load generator includes **realistic outlinks and download behavior**:
- **Outlinks (10% probability)**: Clicks to external websites including:
  - Tech sites: GitHub, Stack Overflow, MDN, W3C
  - Frameworks: React, Vue, Angular, Node.js, jQuery, Bootstrap  
  - Design resources: Tailwind CSS, Font Awesome, Unsplash, Google Fonts
  - Social platforms: YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Medium
- **Downloads (8% probability)**: File downloads including:
  - Documents: PDFs (manuals, guides, whitepapers), presentations, spreadsheets
  - Software: ZIP files, installers, mobile apps, source code
  - Assets: Images, logos, configurations, backups
- **Smart placement**: Events occur randomly within visit pageviews for natural behavior
- **Extended visit duration**: Configurable 1-8 minute visits simulate realistic user engagement

This generates data for Matomo's **Behavior** ‚Üí **Outlinks** and **Behavior** ‚Üí **Downloads** reports, providing insights into user interaction with external content and file downloads.

### Custom Events Simulation
The load generator includes **realistic custom events tracking** to simulate user interactions:

- **Click Events (25% probability)**: UI interaction events including:
  - **Navigation**: Menu clicks, button clicks, link clicks
  - **UI Components**: Tab clicks, accordion clicks, modal opens, image clicks
  - **Social**: Share buttons, like buttons
  - **Forms**: Submit actions, input focus events
  - **Video**: Play/pause controls
  - **Call-to-Actions**: Free trial, quote requests

- **Random Events (12% probability)**: Behavioral and system events including:
  - **Engagement**: Page scrolling, time on page tracking
  - **Performance**: Load time measurements
  - **Errors**: 404 errors, form validation failures
  - **Features**: Tool usage, filter/sort actions
  - **Content**: Print, bookmark actions
  - **Mobile**: Swipe, tap gestures
  - **Analytics**: Conversion goals, exit intent
  - **User**: Login/logout actions

- **Smart placement**: Events occur randomly within visit pageviews (never as first action)
- **Rich metadata**: Each event includes category, action, name, and optional numeric values
- **Matomo compliance**: Uses proper event tracking parameters (`e_c`, `e_a`, `e_n`, `e_v`)

This generates comprehensive data for Matomo's **Behavior** ‚Üí **Events** reports, providing insights into user interactions, engagement patterns, and feature usage beyond basic pageviews.

### Debugging outlinks, downloads & custom events

If you don't see outlinks, downloads, or custom events in Matomo, enable debug logging to see exactly what requests are being sent:

Example debug test (runs with verbose logs and stops after 50 visits):

```bash
# Add LOG_LEVEL to docker-compose.yml environment section
LOG_LEVEL: "DEBUG"

# Or run with environment override
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG MAX_TOTAL_VISITS=50 CONCURRENCY=5 docker compose up --build --abort-on-container-exit

# Check container logs for detailed request information
docker compose logs matomo_loadgen
```

In the debug logs, look for these request types:
- **Outlinks**: Lines showing "Sending outlink hit" with `link=` and `urlref=` parameters
- **Downloads**: Lines showing "Sending download hit" with `download=` and `urlref=` parameters  
- **Custom Events**: Lines showing "Sending custom event" with `e_c=`, `e_a=`, `e_n=` parameters (and optional `e_v=`)

If events still don't appear in Matomo reports:
1. Check that the events are being sent (visible in debug logs)
2. Verify the Matomo server receives the requests (check server access logs)
3. Ensure you're looking in the correct Matomo report sections:
   - **Behavior** ‚Üí **Outlinks** for external link tracking
   - **Behavior** ‚Üí **Downloads** for file download tracking
   - **Behavior** ‚Üí **Events** for custom event tracking

### Behavior guarantees

The load generator enforces several guarantees that help Matomo classify events correctly:

- **Never first action**: Outlinks, Downloads, Site Search, and Custom Events will never be the *first* action in a visit. A regular pageview always precedes any of these events (when the visit contains multiple pageviews).
- **Proper attribution**: For outlink and download hits the generator sets `urlref` to the page URL that contained the link/download. This improves Matomo's ability to attribute and display the click/download in the Outlinks/Downloads reports.
- **URL normalization**: Download entries that are configured as relative paths are converted to fully-qualified URLs using the page's base URL before being sent to Matomo.
- **Event compliance**: Custom events use Matomo's standard event tracking parameters and include proper referrer information for accurate attribution.

These changes are implemented in `matomo-load-baked/loader.py`. Use the debug script and container logs (see above) to verify requests include the expected parameters for each event type.

### Daily cap behavior (MAX_TOTAL_VISITS)

`MAX_TOTAL_VISITS` is interpreted as a per-24-hour cap. When set to a positive integer the load generator will stop producing new visits once that daily cap is reached, then resume production when the 24-hour window resets. This allows the generator to run indefinitely while enforcing a maximum number of visits per day.

Examples:

- `MAX_TOTAL_VISITS=0` (default) ‚Äî no daily cap, generator will run indefinitely (unless `AUTO_STOP_AFTER_HOURS` is set).
- `MAX_TOTAL_VISITS=10000` ‚Äî generator will produce up to 10,000 visits in each rolling 24-hour window, then pause until the window resets.

You can still use `AUTO_STOP_AFTER_HOURS` to explicitly stop the run after a certain number of hours; if both are set, the generator will stop when either condition is met.

Pause log
----------

When the daily cap is reached the generator logs an informational message so you can detect the pause in container logs. The message looks like:

```
[loadgen] daily cap reached (10000). Pausing production until window reset.
```

Quick way to find it in container logs:

```bash
docker compose logs matomo_loadgen | grep "daily cap reached"
```

This helps you confirm the generator paused due to the per-24-hour `MAX_TOTAL_VISITS` limit and not due to an error or container restart.

### Extended Visit Duration
The load generator simulates **realistic visit durations** to create more accurate engagement metrics:
- **Configurable duration range**: Set `VISIT_DURATION_MIN` and `VISIT_DURATION_MAX` in minutes (default: 1-8 minutes)
- **Smart timing calculation**: Total visit duration includes time spent between pageviews plus additional engagement time
- **Natural behavior simulation**: Users appear to stay on the site after their last pageview, simulating content consumption
- **Flexible configuration examples**:
  - Quick browsing: `1.0-3.0` minutes
  - Normal engagement: `2.0-8.0` minutes (default: `1.0-8.0`)
  - Deep engagement: `5.0-15.0` minutes

This creates realistic **session duration data** in Matomo's visitor reports, helping you analyze user engagement patterns and optimize for longer visits.

### Matomo Site Search Configuration
**Important:** You must enable Site Search tracking in Matomo to see the search data generated by Trafficinator.

#### Step 1: Enable Site Search Tracking
1. Go to **Administration** ‚Üí **Websites** ‚Üí **Manage** in your Matomo dashboard
2. Click the **Settings** button for your website
3. Scroll down to the **Site Search** section
4. Change the dropdown from "Do not track Site Search" to **"Site Search tracking enabled"**

#### Step 2: Configure Search Parameters
Choose one of these options:

**Option A (Recommended):** Use default parameters
- Check the box for **"Use default Site Search parameters"**
- Matomo includes `search` in the default parameters

**Option B:** Custom parameters  
- Leave the checkbox unchecked
- In the **"Query parameter"** field, enter: `search`
- In the **"Category parameter"** field, enter: `search_cat`

#### Step 3: Save and View Reports
1. Click **Save** to apply the changes
2. After running Trafficinator, view site search data in:
   - **Behavior** ‚Üí **Site Search** ‚Üí **Search Keywords**
   - **Behavior** ‚Üí **Site Search** ‚Üí **Search Categories**
   - **Behavior** ‚Üí **Site Search** ‚Üí **No Result Keywords**

**Note:** Search events won't appear as regular pageviews - they'll show up specifically in Site Search reports.
